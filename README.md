Game Engine built in C++

This engine was a school project that lasted a single semester. In that time I was able to implement features such as a component system, lighting system, player controllers, scene management, and integration of Box2D and Jolt physics library.

# Running the project
Have cmake installed. [Here's a link if you don't have it installed](https://cmake.org/download/)

Run GenerateProjectFiles.bat
Once that has run, open up the solution in the build folder
